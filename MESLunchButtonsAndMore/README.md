We have a VERY customized MES screen, consisting of only a few buttons. Two of our custom buttons allow a user to "lunch out" and "lunch in" so we can manually track lunch times. 

Epicor doesn't natively support this, but they DO have fields in LaborHed for lunch. This customization sets the lunch times when those buttons are pressed. It also does a few other minor things like directing all numerical input to the EmpID box, so we don't have to worry about 'mousing' the cursor over to the text box.

Note: This is some seriously sloppy code. My apologies.
