PLEASE READ BEFORE SUBMITTING:

To keep things somewhat organized, please create a new folder for each of your submissions. Some projects span across multiple categories (i.e. BPM, BAM, C#, etc) - which is why I don't have categories. Thanks for contributing!

Please try to use descriptive names, and include a readme.md file in your folder briefly describing what your submission does.

PLEASE DO NOT FORK FOR CONTRIBUTIONS; Instead, email me and request an invite to collaborate. This will make browsing much easier for all of us. Thanks!
